## Objectives
- Identify peak sales periods and trends
- Compare sales performance across different branches and cities
- Understand customer preferences based on demographics and purchase behavior
- Analyze payment method distribution for financial planning
- Leverage customer ratings to improve supermarket services

## EDA Methodologies Used
### Data Preparation
- Used Pandas for data exploration and transformation
- Checked and ensured correct data types
- Created new columns for deeper insights

### Analysis & Calculations
- Performed statistical analysis using Pandas
- Explored key sales trends, customer distribution, and product performance

### Visualizations
- Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- Plotted trends, distributions, and sales performance by different variables

## Key Sales Insights
- **Weekly Sales Over Time** â€“ Sales peaked in Week 4, hit the lowest in Week 13, and showed a fluctuating but declining trend.
- **Branch-wise Sales Performance** â€“ Branch A: Home & Lifestyle leads, Branch B: Health & Beauty tops, Branch C: Food & Beverages highest.
- **Gender-wise Sales Distribution** â€“ Females contribute 52% of total sales, males 48%.
- **Sales by Customer Type & Payment Method** â€“ Normal customers prefer E-wallets; Members use Credit Cards the most.
- **City-wise Sales Performance** â€“ Naypyitaw leads (34.2%), followed by Mandalay and Yangon (32.9% each).
- **Customer Type vs. Product Line Sales** â€“ Members buy more Food & Beverages; Normal customers prefer Electronic Accessories.
- **Sales Trend Across Hours** â€“ Peaks at 1 PM and 7 PM; lowest between 5-6 PM before rising in the evening.
- **Customer Rating Distribution** â€“ Ratings range from 4 to 10, with 6 and 7 being the most common.

## Recommendations
